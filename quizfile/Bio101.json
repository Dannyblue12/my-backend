        D: "parasitic",
        Ans: "autotrophic",
        explanation:
          "Autotrophic nutrition refers to the process where organisms produce their own food using inorganic substances. In plants, this occurs through photosynthesis, where chlorophyll captures sunlight to convert CO2 and water into glucose.",
